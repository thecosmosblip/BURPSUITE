									FILE UPLOAD VULNERABILITY
									
							Lab01: Remote code execution via web shell upload
							
 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:

1) First we need to login as wiener creds.
2) Then in my-account upload one jpeg image --> in cmd go to pictures and use command touch new.jpeg and upload this image.
3) Then in same folder create the file test.php and open it in visual studio and enter the command --> <?php system ($_GET['cmd']);?>.
4) Now upload this file in the same place of image section.
5) Select the file or image and open it in new tab and type ?cmd= whoami(any command we want).
6) Now write command cmd = cat /home/carlos/secret and copy the secret and paste it in submit solution section.

							Lab02: Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass
							
 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution: 

1) First we need to login using wieners cred.
2) then we need to upload same php file as above.
3) But now this site will not take php as it only allow png or jpeg.
4) So forward this request and change the content type to image.png or jpeg and send the request.
5) Now php file is uploaded run same command as above and copy the key and paste it in submit solution section.

							Lab03: Web shell upload via path traversal
							
 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. The server is configured to prevent execution of user-supplied files, but this restriction can be bypassed by exploiting a secondary vulnerability.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:

1) First we need to login using wieners creds.
2) Now upload the same file but now we cannot get output on the site.
3) Then send the both request one in which we uploaded the file and other executing command.
3) Now in burpsuite in file where we have given test.php do ../test.php as it we go in previous folder than that.
4) Just convert that into url and send request.
5) Now in other request of executing code we need to remove avatars folder and go into files folder and run same command just change it to --> cat+/home/carlos/secret.
6) Now copy the key and paste it in submit solution section.

							Lab04: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass
							
 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:

1) First we need to login using wieners creds.
2) In this lab we can't upload php files.
3) We need to make new file with name.htaccess as website is using apache server, In file we need to write --> AddType application/x-httpd-php .test.
4) Now we need to save the test.php as test.test file.
5) Now first we need to upload .htaccess file and then test.test file.
6) Now we can execute the command and get the key and submit in submit section.

							Lab05: Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension
							
 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Solution:

1) First we need to login using wieners cred.
2) Then we need to upload the test.php file, but it will not get uploaded as it is blocked.
3) Only png and jpg files are allowed, so we need to send the request of file upload to repeater.
4) In the repeater we need to change the filename from test.php to test.php%00.png and send the request.
5) Now we need to go back to the home and inspect the page and check the file location which is files/avatars/test.php.
6) Go to above location and use the command get the output and submit it in submit section.

							Lab06: Remote code execution via polyglot web shell upload
							
 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it checks the contents of the file to verify that it is a genuine image, it is still possible to upload and execute server-side code.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:

1) First we need to login using wieners creds.
2) Now we need to create new file test.php and write new code --> <?php echo file_put_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?> and upload it in site.
3) But it will not take php file.
4) Now we need to open new terminal and write a command to make polygot file --> exiftool -comment="<?php echo 'START' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'). 'END' ; ?>" 676494.jpg -o polygot.php.
5) Now for this we need one image in same folder and upload the polygot file which gets created in the site.
6) Now we need to search for the START and copy the letters from START to END and submit it in submit section.
