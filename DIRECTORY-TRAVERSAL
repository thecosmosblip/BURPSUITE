							     File path traversal, simple case
							     
This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

Solution:

1) We need to open the lab using intercept ON and then filter to show images also.
2) Take one of the images link and send it to the repeater.
3) In the filename clear the filename path and add /../../../../../etc/passwd and the lab is completed we have access to passwd file.

									        DT-LAB02:
						File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass
						
 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

Solution:

1) This is one of the easiest lab as we need to access the etc/passwd directory which is blocked.
2) So in the filename we just need to type /etc/passwd and send the request using repeater and the lab is solved.

									      DT-LAB03:
						File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively
						
 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application strips path traversal sequences from the user-supplied filename before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

Solution:

1) To solve the lab recursively we just need to add more ../ in the command.
2) first we need to try both commands i.e ../../../../etc/passwd and /etc/passwd.
3) After this we will try ....//....//....//....//etc/passwd.
4) The above command will work because the system is not checking the command recursively.
5) Here ../ will not work because developer has blocked the setting.

DT-LAB04:
					File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode
					
 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks input containing path traversal sequences. It then performs a URL-decode of the input before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

Solution:

1) We need to do same steps.
2) enter the command ../../../../etc/passwd and right click and convert selection --> url encode all 2 times and do http1.1.

									DT-LAB05:
						 	File path traversal, validation of start of path
						 	
 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application transmits the full file path via a request parameter, and validates that the supplied path starts with the expected folder.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

Solution:

1) We need to access the /etc/passwd directory for the user.
2) we need to send one image request to the repeater and their path is filename=/var/www/images/34.jpg so we just need to go out of this path.
3) /var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd by using this command we get the access to the /etc/passwd folder and lab is solved.

**************************************************************

									DT-LAB06:
						File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass
						
 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application validates that the supplied filename ends with the expected file extension.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

Solution:

1) We need to do same process as before, if any of the first five steps didnt work then we need to try this step.
2) use filename=../../../etc/passwd%0070.jpg this command as %00 ignore the command written after that.
3) All the labs for the DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL are completed.
