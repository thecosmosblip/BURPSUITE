								Excessive trust in client-side controls
								
 This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:
1) First we need to login with the account of wiener that is provided.
2) after login to the account we will be having $100 credits and need to add the product to the cart that is given.
3) Go into the cart and place order for the product which will fail as the amount for product is high.
4) forward the checkout and cart post request to the repeater.
5) In the cart at the bottom in price change the price to 1 and before that remove the product from cart.
6) send the request of the cart and the lab is completed.

								High-level logic vulnerability
								
 This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:
1) First we need to login with the account of wiener that is provided.
2) after login to the account we will be having $100 credits and need to add the product to the cart that is given.
3) add another product to the cart and send the both request to the repeater.
4) Now in the repeater enter the cart product quantity as -products for another product selected till we reach below 100$ and above 1$.
5) Now place the order and lab is completed.

								Inconsistent security controls
								
This lab's flawed logic allows arbitrary users to access administrative functionality that should only be available to company employees. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos. 

Solution:
1) We need to register with the new account.
2) In the site link we need to add /admin and it will popup that login as @Dontwannacry to login as admin.
3) So for that we need to create an account and in the email section add email exploit that is present at the top.
4) The email will be sent to the exploit email and after clicking on email it notifies as account verified.
5) Then we need to login with same user and update email as @Dontwannacry.
6) After that go to admin panel and delete user that is given.

 								      Low-level logic flaw
 								      
 This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:
1) login as the wiener account given in the description.
2) Here in this lab we need to find out how much maximum quanitiy of product we can buy in 100$.
3) First we need to add the product in the cart than send the request to repeater and then add quantity as 99 and send the request and reload the page.
4) Send the above request to intruder and remove product from cart.
5) In the intruder dont select anything just keep clear and in payload type keep null payload and use indefinitely pauload in resource pool create new pool as 1 repeat and start attack.
6) keep refreshing the site after some times and pause the site when we receive the negative amount.
7) than divide the total amount by the product price and divide that amount by 99 and use that number and new payload.
8) In the new payload keep generate payload amount as we receive by above maths and bring the value till it becomes between 0 to 100$.
9) Use different product which has less amounts so it becomes easier, Hence lab solved.

									Business Lab-07
								Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint
								
 This lab makes a flawed assumption about the user's privilege level based on their input. As a result, you can exploit the logic of its account management features to gain access to arbitrary users' accounts. To solve the lab, access the administrator account and delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution: 
1) First we need to login as wiener and peter as the password
2) Then we need to check the vulnerability that how can we change the administrator password.
3) First try changing email for the account.
4) Then try changing the password.
5) send the password change proxy to the repeater.
6) change the username to administrator and remove the current password field and change the password.
7) now login as administrator and login to admin panel and delete carlos.

									Business Lab-08
								 Insufficient workflow validation
								 
 This lab makes flawed assumptions about the sequence of events in the purchasing workflow. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:

1) Login to the website as user weiner and password peter.
2) we have 100$ but we need to purchase the jacket worth $1337.
3) try purchasing the product which is less than 100$.
4) Add one product which is worth less than 100$ and purchase that product.
5) Add the product purchased proxy to the repeater.
6) Now go back and add leather jacket to the cart and than send the above repeater request through burpsuite.
7) Lab solved.

									Business Lab-09
							 Authentication bypass via flawed state machine

 This lab makes flawed assumptions about the sequence of events in the login process. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to bypass the lab's authentication, access the admin interface, and delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Solution:

1) First we need to login as the credentials that we have been provided.
2) Now we need to try to find out the vulnerability.
3) There is the new section as role selector.
4) Try login in as Weiner and password peter and change the user role from user to administrator/admin from request.
5) First we need to send the request for above change to take place.
6) If that didn't work we need to logout and login again and try new methods.
7) Try login in again now first turn on the intercept and then login as wiener.
8) Now forward the request through incepetor and delete the role-selector site domain and forward the request.
9) Now as the role is not selected we will get the admin-panel and can delete the carlos account.
